In a circle and then you come back to point a again the exact same point then we say your speed here is 5 km per hour but your velocity here is zero and the reason it is zero is because there is no directional again you started in the same point and then you came back at the same point again even if you want to work for mirrors this way 2 m this way. 4 m this way and then 2 metres of here then your velocity or average velocity is zero km per hour the difference between the two is like the difference between distance and displacement basically if you not sure about that when i will make a very quick video like this about it thank you so much guys just quickly while i'm working on different videos there are longer i'll see on the next one.' the ideal output is 'This text delves into the fundamental difference between speed and velocity in physics. The author, likely a physics educator, explains that while both terms relate to movement, velocity encompasses both speed and direction, making it a vector quantity. Speed, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity, meaning it only considers the magnitude of motion. The author emphasizes this distinction using a simple example of cycling to a park. Riding at 5 km/h represents speed, but if one circles back to the starting point, their overall velocity becomes zero because there is no net change in direction. The concept of displacement is then introduced as analogous to velocity, while distance is compared to speed. The text concludes with an assurance of future video explanations for those seeking further clarification on these concepts.' ")
